# Blocklist: Unsolicited Outreach Domains

The `domains.txt` file contains a list of domain names — one per line — associated with companies that have acquired my contact information through third-party data brokers such as:

- Lusha  
- ZoomInfo  
- Cognism  
- Seamless  
- Apollo  
- LeadIQ  
- Slintel  
- ...and others

These domains are a persistent source of unsolicited outreach and nuisance communication.

## Recommendation

I block these domains **at the SMTP level** on my email gateways. Doing so help reduce spam and protect from unwanted marketing attempts.
